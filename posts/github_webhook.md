We have liftoff! Now when I push to my github repository, github will send a request to my api which will trigger a pull and rebuild. Testing with this post!

Hmmm. Something appeared to have went wrong. Guess after this test fails I will just test the exec portion of the code.

It looks like its timing out. Maybe my secret didnt refresh so I am trying to restart nodeservice.
