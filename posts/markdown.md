In case you were wondering about some of my posts mentioning that I posted them using iphone terminal application, this does not mean I am simply writing html to load. I am working with the base the tutorial gave me which reads markdown(gray-matter) from the filesystem and translates it to html. Markdown is a pretty neat format that allows you to specify metadata and gives you shortcuts for formatting text. Like if you put 2 * at the beginning and end of a string it makes it bold. On my todo list is creating an admin area of the site that allows me to use an online editor to write markdown instead of requiring use of ssh.

However one must take care when adding authentication to a system. Too many bad actors these days. I will have to make sure it does not allow infinite guesses of password. And I will need to use a login other than keith or something else easily guessable. I may even experiment with requiring certificate to login to the website.
