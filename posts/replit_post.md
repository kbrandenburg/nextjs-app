I have been a little behind in my updates this week, I have been pushing hard at work to get their online store updated from magento 1 to magento 2. 

Magento 2 is packed with a lot of interesting technologies. Perhaps adobe's acquisition of the product will work out in its benefit. I am learning about varnish and elasticsearch. More good stuff to be knowledgeable about. 

I am testing writing posts from replit.com. I was able to successfully pull my recent changes from github to their online ide/testbed and if you see this post that means I was able to push to github and the webhook was able to be received and handled correctly by my server.

Happy friday!
