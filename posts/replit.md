Originally I stumbled upon replit.com when I was looking for a free host for node for sharing my apps with friends. I found the tools pretty neat, the online ide with built in version control with ability to pull from github easily was slick. I also checked out glitch.io but I ran into issues with my server randomly not working.

After I setup a vps account I did not expect replit.com would still be handy. But a thought came to me. If I wasn't with my macbook I could take advantage of replit.com as my online anywhere editor. (Once we modify code to use server mongodb). It has a test environment I could use before needing to publish to GitHub. And allows commits and pushing to GitHub! Once I get my webhook set up on the server this will mean as soon as I push from replit my changes will go live to the production website!

Of course its easier to use local ide and toolset with macbook in hand but I still find it pretty neat you can accomplish all this in the webbrowser.
